Started learning IT abilities at my early stages, my father as a Software Engineer with large experience teached me since my childhood how does a computer work, how to repair it on hardware and software level. Later in my adolescence i started learning programming basics with Scratch, Python and C++. Droped my computer engineer carreer at second year, there i learned C++ and Java basics.  
My first official job in IT was at CordobaTSI where i worked with both hardware and software, programming some scripts and repairing pcs and printers. At the same time started an own entrepreneurship repairing PCs, laptops, and also making crypto miners.  
At the same time started a full stack developer course where i learned Python, Django, NodeJs, JavaScript, Git and HTML.  
At the moment i'm learning at ISPC the carreer of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.  
I trully believe that the best job is one where i can keep learning about new technologies and improving myself.
